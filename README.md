# NetrunningNexus
A python based GUI for managing cyberdecks and programs/ICE/hardware for Cyberpunk RED

# Installation
Installation is very simple, you just need to have python, tkinter, and PIL installed, and then you need to clone the repo<br>
https://www.python.org/downloads/ <br>
```pip install tk``` <br>
```pip install Pilow```

# Usage
Run ```nexus.py```, this will show a splashscreen, and then open up the main menu <br>
You're given the option between managing a cyberdeck or managing programs/ICE/hardware <br>
All files are stored as .json in the data folder for easy access, editing, and homebrew <br>
The maximum cyberdeck slots right now is hard capped at 10, I plan to update this later to allow you to choose the max
